Joel Welling earned a Ph.D. in computational gravitational physics
from the University of Pittsburgh in 1983.  Following a stay at the
Max Plank Institute for Astrophysics he joined the PSC at its
inception in 1985.  Over the years he has led or been deeply involved
in many projects in many fields, including visualization, telescope
astronomy, deep learning and general machine learning, simulations
related to public health, and most recently the PSC's component of the
HuBMAP project.  Welling spent 10 years in a joint research position
with the CMU Department of Statistics developing algorithms and
software for functional brain imaging.

Welling has been the primary author or core author of many software
packages, including DrawCGM, DrawP3D, VFleet, and StarSplatter
(visualization), FIASCO/FIAT (functional brain imaging), HERMES
(event-based simulation of vaccine transport), and RHEA (parallel
agent-based simulation of disease transmission).  He led the
implementation of the workflow infrastructure which processes data
submitted to the HuBMAP HIVE.  He has contributed to several other
packages including VisIt and the analysis software for the Pan-STARRS
telescope.  Welling has taught courses in computer graphics and
computational physics for the CMU Computer Science and Physics
departments respectively.
